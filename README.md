# My Name
Welcome to this project, which is based on what I learned in my senior year, first semester!

## Courses and Activities
- **Open SW**: In this course, Covered computer vision techniques, deep neural networks, and image processing using C/C++ with OpenCV and Python with Numpy/Pytorch. Explored various topics from geometric transformations to deep learning architectures.

- **Compiler Theory**: This course focused on the theory of compilers and their practical applications. We implemented a compiler for a mini high-level language using tools such as Lex and Yacc, covering topics like lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and code optimization.
  
- **Automata Theory and Theory of Computation** : Explored foundational concepts like regular languages and context-free languages, crucial for understanding compiler design and construction.
  
- **Operating Systems**: Focused on core concepts, roles, and components of operating systems. Covered system structure, process management, memory management, file system implementation, disk management, and CPU scheduling.
